⚠️ DEPRECATED FILE - DO NOT USE

This file is no longer part of the active system.
All face detection now runs in the frontend via MediaPipe JS.

🚀 USE INSTEAD:
  Backend: python app_mediapipe_js.py  (logging only)
  Frontend: useMediaPipeJS hook + FaceMetricsMonitor component

Migration completed in previous iteration.
File kept for historical reference only.
